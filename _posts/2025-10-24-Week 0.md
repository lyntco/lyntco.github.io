I've decided to write a blog on the progress of the Ultimate Indie Program from Gamedev.tv.
I have wanted to write a blog on Game Dev for a while but generally fizzled out and stopped - I wrote a [blog](https://lyntco.tumblr.com/) when I did a 3 month Bootcamp at General Assembly and I found that it was a good way to summarize the things I worked on, and reinforce learnings, as well as keep my brain engaged to the program.

This blog will be for the program as well as other things, and I will tag these properly so they can be filtered out easily! I have a lot of interests.
I took a bit of time getting the theme to work but turns out I just need to read instructions properly haha
Its a very fancy theme and I probably wont even need all the features.

[Ultimate Indie](https://gamedev.tv/courses/ultimate-indie-2025q4) kicks off at 7am Monday the 26th. There is some advice on which bracket to go into and as much as I'd like to join team Game 2, I haven't actually released a playable game into the world yet despite doing half of some tutorials and barely getting something out for some game jams. So I will stick to Game 1 unless I get advice that I can try the Game 2 team.

## Game 1 ideas
I am currently in the middle of a Vampire Survivors tutorial, so I'm thinking I could just use it as the game. But I do have other ideas, like an idle game or some other game that is very small scope.

## Game 2 ideas

I participated in the Ludum Dare that just happened, though very casually because I forgot I had things on that weekend I realistically only spent maybe 10 hours on it total instead of the 72 hours, or even the later date of the weeks long length because we also went to Melbourne for PAX in that time. I decided I didn't want to stress over it so I did what I could in the time that I had and made the beginnings of a claw machine game (["playable" here](https://strawdoll.itch.io/ld58-clawmania)). I was thinking I could flesh this one out and add some of the actual game elements I planned to put into it.
This one may be even too much for a Game 2? I think the idea behind the Game 1 and 2 teams is to not have to invent a full game loop so I think this one may be too much.

Anyhow we will get to it on Monday! I'm so glad that the calls are a reasonable time for Sydney - I was worried it would be like 4am or something but based on the schedule it'll be 7am for us!
