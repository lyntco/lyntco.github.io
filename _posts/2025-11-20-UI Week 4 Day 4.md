I woke up at 6 ish this morning because our dog likes to take up my leg space gradually over the night until I'm nearly falling off the bed. 

But I had the thought that each container can have a DispenseIngredient component because when it's spilling it will be dispensing to the thing under it technically. I'm not 100% sure how this will work with events though. Maybe I wrote things all fine and it'll just work (not likely) 😅

Next items on the list:
1. Spilling to the item underneath
2. Displaying the single ingredient in the containers
3. Displaying multiple layered liquid ingredients in the containers
4. Displaying larger particle ingredients in the containers

On 2 and 3 I'm really trying to make the display represent the data. I know it can be that the GameObjects alter the data too - but maybe that will be better for toppings and ice. Liquid particles never look good to me - and they are almost always geared at larger bodies of water. I am interested in figuring it out one day but that's not what I'm interested in today.

## Spilling to the container underneath

I guess everything can be a container? The stand will be able to hold *some* water and the ground, while not really infinite can hold a lot of water. This is funny to me. Now I'm thinking about situations where a customer is a container and can have capacity in their stomach, or on their surface where they can be spilled on. Imagine a quest where someone is on fire and you have to throw water on them!

The other idea is that you can stack cups in a triangle and make a tower from pouring. This is a fun way to make a mechanic I think. Give building blocks and let people play. I love that Breath of the Wild had a 2d version where they tested building blocks.

A thing to note here is that if a container is spilling, it should also get stained. This way I can add the effect where if you spill you have to clean the item that is spilled to continue.

I've had a bit of a read of events stuff and I may have to re write a bit to make sure the correct container is dispensing since the way I have it, everything with the DispenseIngredient script will call DispenseTo if I leave it ias it is. I'll try it any ways since I have been committing everything to github.

I think the main issue is that I need to spawn a new pouring prefab so it can figure out what it will spill onto first!

I actually wanted to fix the pouring prefab not sticking to the jug so I asked good old ChatGPT how I could do that and it told me to reset the rotation in the LateUpdate() if I add it as a child to the jug:

And it works how I want it! When AI works its great, when it doesn't it can waste *hours*.

Next part is to spawn the prefab on the cup. I guess it can be copied into the cup object with an offset for now. I'll get rid of the cylinder in the cup for now so I can see it. I'll make it so the spilling activates the pour object of the cup with some helper functions:

![Desktop View]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/2025-11-20/spill07.png){: w="400" }

.. and holy crap it looks like it works? I didn't expect it to work straight away!?!?!

I wish it was easier to see what was going on. I guess the next step is shaders to show volume levels!

I was a bit distracted with a few things today - my IKEA order got here so I made my new set of drawers for my extra notebooks/sketchbooks could go into so my desks could be more clear! 

I also tried to add [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) and [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) to this blog - I'm not sure if it worked though? Maybe it takes a little while to show up.

And then I decided to play with fire by opening Q-UP again and a few hours left my body 😂 No more for me until the end of the course! I'd like to actually get closer to finishing my game!

I'm happy I get at least one thing done a day at least, I'd rather do a little every day than none for months!
Tomorrow I continue the spilling and then also try to represent the volumes in the containers. No need to color them nicely yet!
