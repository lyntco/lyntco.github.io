Yesterday was pretty full since we went bike riding and watch the end of Celebrity Traitors UK with our friends so I didn't get a chance to do much on this but I'm back to it today. I also spent a little but of time playing some other people's projects and giving feedback, I'd like ot make sure I keep doing it! 

Today I'm going to round up all the feedback I got and organise it in a way that makes sense to add an order to action the items.

Here is the list of feedback:

## Feedback

### Small change suggestions

- on the sliders
  - It wasn't clear to everyone that the sliders are sliders
    - maybe change the arrow to something else
  - some people clicked higher on the bar and started with a very fast fill rate
  - the 0 zone is not big enough for turning off the flow
  - The order of sliders seems out of order - its easier to put the pearls in first
  - the sliders could be made to look more like levers or taps to help indicate what they do

- on the recipe indicators/order
  - it was hard to tell which ingredient should line up to each line

- on the seal cup
  - allowing player to seal cup when lower than 95% is wanted, player choice!
  - there should be feedback on how well you did based on how close you were to the recipe, eg F tier to S+++ 😂

- Overflow
  - there should be a spill penalty
  - it shouldn't stop you from pouring if you overflow, you should have to turn off the pouring

### Additions/Larger change suggestions
- time pressure
- force tough decisions (a la papers please money phase)
- each ingredient should have a different mechanic, for example pearls should be scooped
- button mash to make the pour rate go up and then decay (add a hold instead for accessibility)
- customer feedback after getting their drink
- funny customers (like [Jorji](https://papersplease.fandom.com/wiki/Jorji_Costava))
- seasons for seasonal drinks
- customer order modifiers
- customer order recall ("can i get what you gave me yesterday?")




## Thinking more on the end look of the game

I decided to go look at what other Boba games there were - I found a fairly simple one [here](https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/bubble-tea-asmr). It was quite satisfying to have the pearls be individual balls with liquid physics


## Isometric pixel art

I really love pixel art. 

Additionally, this work by t3ssel8r has inspired me for years:

They also have a full write up on imgur here that is pretty high level: https://imgur.com/gallery/creating-pixel-art-scene-realtime-3d-qwhbHQq

I've seen a few re implementations but I haven't tried to myself yet! I may have to experiment further down the line.

JohnBrx has a real 2D isometric project:

And Halls of Torment is 2d

But I always wonder how much a headache it is to actually do fake 3D in a 2D environment, especially with elevation.

A side note, I have thought about faking 3d sprites by doing what [dead cells did with their character model](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/art-design-deep-dive-using-a-3d-pipeline-for-2d-animation-in-i-dead-cells-i-#) and then having a 3d model behindit while you billboard the sprite.

I got this idea from both the [Pathway](https://steamcommunity.com/games/546430/announcements/detail/1700601856676355706) devlog and the [Enigma of fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t2PRRnE8vo&t=5746s) dev video.

### Liquid sims

I'd love it if the tea could look like this example from AdamCYounis:

I found a few more tutorials on liquid effects here too:
