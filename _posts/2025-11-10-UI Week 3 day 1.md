Yesterday was pretty full since we went bike riding and watch the end of Celebrity Traitors UK with our friends so I didn't get a chance to do much on this but I'm back to it today. I also spent a little but of time playing some other people's projects and giving feedback, I'd like ot make sure I keep doing it! 

Today I'm going to round up all the feedback I got and organise it in a way that makes sense to add an order to action the items.

Here is the list of feedback:

## Small change suggestions

- on the sliders
  - It wasn't clear to everyone that the sliders are sliders
    - maybe change the arrow to something else
  - some people clicked higher on the bar and started with a very fast fill rate
  - the 0 zone is not big enough for turning off the flow
  - The order of sliders seems out of order - its easier to put the pearls in first
  - the sliders could be made to look more like levers or taps to help indicate what they do

- on the recipe indicators/order
  - it was hard to tell which ingredient should line up to each line

- on the seal cup
  - allowing player to seal cup when lower than 95% is wanted, player choice!
  - there should be feedback on how well you did based on how close you were to the recipe, eg F tier to S+++ 😂

- Overflow
  - there should be a spill penalty
  - it shouldn't stop you from pouring if you overflow, you should have to turn off the pouring

## Additions/Larger change suggestions
- time pressure
- force tough decisions (a la papers please money phase)
- each ingredient should have a different mechanic, for example pearls should be scooped
- button mash to make the pour rate go up and then decay (add a hold instead for accessibility)
- customer feedback after getting their drink
- 



## Thinking more on the end look of the game

I decided to go look at what other Boba games there were - I found a fairly simple one [here](https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/bubble-tea-asmr)
