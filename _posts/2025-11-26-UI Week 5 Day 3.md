Looks like both goatcounter and giscus are working! Just needed to update my config file. I don't expect to see too much activity but I guess it's nice to open an avenue for discussion. I also disabled the PWA on this page because the caching was driving me a bit mad.

I have had a bit on in the past few days - my cousins wedding, prep for it and then needing to recover from it 😂 There have been so many events on. Maybe because it's the end of the year. Anyhow it's been hard to find time to put into this. 

And it's been too long since my last entry! 

My focus is to make sure the dispensing is working correctly. The pouring line showed up correctly but I didn't verify if the container pouring was dispensing only to the cup and that the cup was dispensing to the table underneath.

I am really amused with the "everything is a container" idea. Maybe I can put a container in a container? Strict typing says no 🤣 But my brain says yes. I'll think about it. Maybe it should be many containers that are held by a container instead of many ingredients in a container? I can rework this later. For now: Make the cup spill!

## Verifying the spill target

My logs are very noisy at the moment. I need to have some easier visibility on what's happening that isn't gong to flood a constantly moving console, or a console that stops scrolling if there are too many logs. I guess its time to add a debug UI so I can just read the current state in text instead of follow a long log list.

![Desktop View]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/2025-11-26/debug01.png){: w="400" }

Simple setup of a UI Toolkit doc. Now I gotta make a script to hook up values and make em update:

![Desktop View]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/2025-11-26/debug02.png){: w="400" }

And it's doing the job:

{% include embed/video.html src='/assets/img/posts/2025-11-26/debug03.mp4' autoplay=true loop=true muted=true %}

Time to add containers to the stand and ground! The measurements art for a cylinder but for now I'll leave it. I just need volumes. I also need to add colliders to the stand and ground. With this I can pour directly to the stand and ground but the spilling isn't collecting the pouring correctly.
