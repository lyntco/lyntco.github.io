## Thinking more on the end look of the game



## Isometric pixel art

I really love pixel art. 

Additionally, this work by t3ssel8r has inspired me for years:

They also have a full write up on imgur here that is pretty high level: https://imgur.com/gallery/creating-pixel-art-scene-realtime-3d-qwhbHQq

I've seen a few re implementations but I haven't tried to myself yet! I may have to experiment further down the line.

JohnBrx has a real 2D isometric project:

And Halls of Torment is 2d

But I always wonder how much a headache it is to actually do fake 3D in a 2D environment, especially with elevation.

A side note, I have thought about faking 3d sprites by doing what [dead cells did with their character model](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/art-design-deep-dive-using-a-3d-pipeline-for-2d-animation-in-i-dead-cells-i-#) and then having a 3d model behindit while you billboard the sprite.

I got this idea from both the [Pathway](https://steamcommunity.com/games/546430/announcements/detail/1700601856676355706) devlog and the [Enigma of fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t2PRRnE8vo&t=5746s) dev video.

### Liquid sims

I'd love it if the tea could look like this example from AdamCYounis:

I found a few more tutorials on liquid effects here too:
