I have been wanting to add an entry about the art style I'd like to make Boba Tycoon. I think from the first thumbnails I drew I thought it would be cute to have an isometric pixel art style, with lo fi hip hop style music in the background.

I have experience in pixel art, but not really towards a game, or any animation. I didn't think I needed that much animation in the game, but after thinking of adding intractable items rather than making it all UI I think it will have a better feel to have animations.

However, animations with liquid may end up being not so satisfying if hand drawn. I really love the charm of the pixel art in the older Cooking Mama games, but the physics of the 3d objects was also satisfying.

## Isometric pixel art

I really love pixel art. I think looks great and it can be done in so many different ways that really show the voice of the artist.

Additionally, this work by t3ssel8r has inspired me for years:

They also have a full write up on imgur [here that is pretty high level on imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/creating-pixel-art-scene-realtime-3d-qwhbHQq). I have had only a tiny bit of shader writing experience that was heavily assisted by ChatGPT so I'm probably too green to full make sense of 

I've seen a few re implementations but I haven't tried to myself yet! I may have to experiment further down the line.

JohnBrx has a 2D isometric project:

And Halls of Torment is 2d

But I always wonder how much a headache it is to actually do fake 3D in a 2D environment, especially with elevation.

A side note, I have thought about faking 3d sprites by doing what [dead cells did with their character model](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/art-design-deep-dive-using-a-3d-pipeline-for-2d-animation-in-i-dead-cells-i-#) and then having a 3d model behindit while you billboard the sprite.

I got this idea from both the [Pathway](https://steamcommunity.com/games/546430/announcements/detail/1700601856676355706) devlog and the [Enigma of fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t2PRRnE8vo&t=5746s) dev video.

### Liquid sims

I'd love it if the tea could look like this example from AdamCYounis:

I found a few more tutorials on 2D liquid effects here too:
