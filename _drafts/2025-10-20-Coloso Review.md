As a beginner this course really does deliver on this title - the only thing I have done with blender before this course is the blender donut tutorial on youtube!
The use of DAZ is a great way to cut down time to make a complete scene, it's a small use in the start but LouLL_AroLL teaches how to bring the model into blender and adjust the face and body way past what you can get out of DAZ, which means you don't have to rely on what DAZ gives you. He explains well what makes a "beautiful" face and shows you how he does guidelines for himself to make the shapes nicer.
He also shows a lot of techniques to layer makeup and tattoos so you can really do a lot to make a character your own, and takes you through hairstyles.
He talks you through making a bodysuit but not the second set of clothes - that is an included video you can watch but it is not voiced. You can follow along fine though, i did it with the air conditioning props.
A word of warning when you do this though: make sure your model is symmetrical coming out of DAZ and while you are sculpting and reshaping the body because blender's symmetry features don't work on non symmetrical models!
I really like how he takes you through the modelling of the prize catcher and toys inside and the UV unwrapping - I was hoping he would talk us through the air conditioners but the included video was easy enough to follow along to so i modelled my own while watching his videos.

I'm still only halfway through and I'm up to the first pass of posing the characters in the scene, with stuff like adding detail and realism and rendering and post production, as well as reaching out with your art.
Overall I'm really impressed by the content in this and I think it suits beginners and gives them to tools to carry on - after doing some of this I'm pretty confident to tackle other items and have modelled some shoes and clothing, even though I still need to follow some guides, I feel confident enough to fix issues when they occur.
