# Hi! I'm Lyn, but I mostly go by Strawdoll/Straw.

A general history of me is that I have been online since I was 7 and doing "computery" and "arty" stuff ever since.

A longer history:
My career of the last 11 years has been Full Stack Web development but I originally got into coding because I wanted to make games, and have been a big indie game lover for a very long time. The Web Dev side tracked me a lot, but I had a few tries at making some games, never getting an actually playable thing out for people to play and give me feedback. I also worked on drawing and did some Live2D rigging and streaming on Twitch, as well as some 3D modeling in blender more recently.

Before Web Dev I was studying Graphic Design which was also the side tracked version of what I actually wanted to do - Illustration/the other kind of design. I also worked a year at Walt Disney World as a mascot character for a year, but that's not super relevant here.

Somewhere weaved into the Graphic design and High School I found a place on Deviantart where I made some friends through digital illustration (anime style) and eventually Cosplay and Photography.

And around the end of Primary School to early high school before Deviantart I was making Pixel dolls, but I can't seem to find any archived sites which is a bit of a shame!

Somewhere in the later end of my primary school I made the school's website! I don't think many adults at the school knew how to do it but somehow I offered to help and did a lot of the small site that it ended up being.

I enjoy a lot of different things and I will probably write about more than just Game Dev here.

Also, I'm married to [Cooptayto](https://scoutski.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, you can check out his blog on the Ultimate Indie program blog there too.
